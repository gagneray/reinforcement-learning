# Reinforcement learning

This library is based on the book [Reinforcement Learning](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reinforcement-learning-second-edition) By Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. The goal is to implement all the relevant examples provided in this book. This is a personal project aiming to learn about reinforcement learning and at the same to train my developer skills.

Only one chapter of the book is available at the moment, the first one about the multi-armed bandits problem. This is still a work in progress, but it's functional.
